I also used lots of the documentation for built in functions on http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/, too many to remember/list.

main.cpp - UI driver for the program

node - class that creates a node, is utilized by LList.

LList -  creates a Linked List consisting of nodes

Day - holds the data for a given day, utilizes an LList

Week- has a simple array of days, and many funtions that operate on them.
